                I’m an after degree student studying Computing Science at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. I’ve always had a passion for science, and approaching problems in a very methodical and analytical way, and enjoyed developing these skills throughout my first degree in Astrophysics.

                I wasn’t exposed to computing science until part way through my degree in Astrophysics, where I started coding with MatLab and Python for my lab courses. I enjoyed approaching problems and coming up with solutions through computational thinking. It was from this that I really became interested in the subject and decided to pursue an after degree.

                It wasn’t until I started studying computing science that I began to realize and appreciate the importance of a well designed solution that’s accessible to everyone, whatever that solution may be.

                I’m interested in using my degree as an opportunity to explore how and where I can use my skills to apply this statement. Most recently, I’ve been interested in and exploring how this applies through the role of front-end development, but I’m still trying to figure it all out.
